# 📝 MinimalTodo — iOS To-Do List App

> A lightweight and distraction-free To-Do List app for iOS, built with SwiftUI.  
> Designed to keep only what truly matters — your tasks.

---

## 🧩 Overview
**MinimalTodo** is a simple and elegant To-Do List app built for iOS.  
It was created from the idea of reducing unnecessary complexity in task management apps — keeping only the features that genuinely improve focus and productivity.

The app offers a clean interface, smooth animations, and minimal cognitive load.  
It embodies the concept of *digital minimalism* — helping users manage tasks efficiently without overwhelming design or cluttered features.

---

## 🎯 Motivation
Most to-do apps today are overloaded with tags, projects, and integrations that end up distracting more than helping.  
I wanted to build something different — an app that feels **calm, fast, and intuitive**.  

This project became my experiment in:
- Designing minimal but meaningful user interactions  
- Implementing efficient state management in SwiftUI  
- Building a complete yet focused product experience

## 💬 Personal Reflection
Building *MinimalTodo* deepened my understanding of **user-centered design** and **SwiftUI architecture**.  
It taught me that minimalism in software is not about removing features,  
but about **keeping only what enhances the user’s flow and purpose**.  

This project reflects my ongoing interest in **Human-Computer Interaction** and my goal to create interfaces that are both functional and calming to use.
